<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! My name is Ayaan Aziz, and I am a 14-year-old student from Dubai. I
  have a keen interest in technology and am currently taking an online web
  development course on Udemy to enhance my skills. As an IGCSE student, I am
  studying computer science, food and nutrition, business studies, and physics.
  Besides programming, my hobbies include horse riding, skiing, and swimming.

  I am also a big Jurassic fan and am currently watching Chaos Theory. I love
  the thrill of the adventures and the depth of the characters. Watching these
  shows not only entertains me but also inspires my creativity and imagination.
  I often find myself thinking about the various scenarios and challenges the
  characters face, which helps me develop problem-solving skills. Additionally,
  I enjoy discussing the series with fellow fans and exploring fan theories
  online. This passion for Jurassic World has also sparked an interest in
  learning more about dinosaurs and paleontology.

  Looking ahead, I aspire to build a career in the tech industry, perhaps as a
  web developer or a software engineer. My goal is to leverage my skills to
  create innovative solutions and contribute to exciting projects. This web
  development course is the first step towards achieving my dreams, and I am
  excited about the journey ahead.
